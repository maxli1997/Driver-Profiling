This study proposes a novel approach to classifying driving styles and exploring how different age groups and gender affect interactions with ADAS.

DATA:

The study utilized two naturalistic driving datasets, involving 148 drivers from four age groups
(teens, younger, middle-aged, and older adults).

METHOD:

The K-means clustering algorithm was first employed to divide trips into one conservative and two aggressive groups based on three
behavior metrics: tailgating, speeding, and lane changing. The aggressive-trip ratios were then calculated for each driver during the two periods. Bayesian Gaussian Mixture model was applied to determine the threshold values of the aggressive-trip ratios to further classify drivers as conservative, moderate, or aggressive during each period. This allowed for identifying the shift in driversâ€™ driving style upon the activation of ADAS. 

CONCLUSION:

The Multinomial Logistic Regression model results showed that driving styles vary across age groups, with teens exhibiting the most aggressive driving style. Some style-shifting behavior was observed, with some conservative drivers becoming aggressive or moderate, while some aggressive drivers became conservative or moderate, but these differences were statistically non-significant.
